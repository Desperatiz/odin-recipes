       <li>1/3 cup cooked and crumbled bulk italian sausage</li>
       <li>1/3 cup chopped pepperoni</li>
       <li>1 pound fresh pizza dough</li>
       <li>1 1/4 cups pizza sauce</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil, or to taste</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste</li>
       <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Combine mozzarella, sausage, and pepperoni in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a work surface, and roll out dough 1/4-inch thick. Cut rounds with a biscuit or cookie cutter, and stretch each piece. Place a dollop of pizza sauce on each round, and top with about 1 tablespoon meat mixture. Fold dough over toppings into a ball, pinching the bottom to seal well; set aside, seam side down. </li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Garnish with grated Parmesan, and serve with pizza sauce for dipping. </li>
